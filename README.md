# ParticleSwarmOptimiser
A small Fortran 90 particle swarm optimiser

Please start by reading PSOTest.f90, this program runs the optimiser, to switch in a model please
update the testfunc subroutine in the functions.f90 file.

Use 'make target' to make the binary and 'make clean' to remove the objects.
